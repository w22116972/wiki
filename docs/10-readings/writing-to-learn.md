# Writing to Learn

## Writing is thinking made visible

Writing is thinking on paper
- forces one to organize thoughts, to see what is understood vs what is not. 
- If you can’t explain something clearly in writing, often you don’t fully understand it. 
- Writing is not just a vehicle for communication—it is itself part of the learning process.

Simplicity and Clarity
- avoid jargon, inflated vocabulary, or unnecessary complexity
- Short, precise sentences are generally more effective for learning than long, convoluted ones.

Keep frequent, informal writing (notes, reflections, summaries)
