# Challenge: Designing for Deduplication and Consistency in High-Concurrency Systems

## 1. Problem Statement

In high-concurrency scenarios (e.g., payment processing, stock trading, flash sales), systems must handle duplicate requests that can arise from client retries, network issues, or asynchronous job replays. Without proper design, this can lead to critical business errors:
- **Duplicate Submissions:** A single user action is processed multiple times (e.g., a customer is charged twice).
- **Overselling Stock:** Inventory is decremented below zero.
- **Data Corruption:** The system's state becomes inconsistent.

The goal is to build a multi-layered defense system that ensures the **idempotence** of critical operations while maintaining high performance.

## 2. Layer 1: API / Gateway Layer

Defense should begin at the system's entry point. This layer is primarily concerned with handling duplicates caused by client behavior and network retries.

- **Client-Side Controls:** The simplest defense is to prevent users from accidentally submitting a form multiple times by disabling the submit button after the first click.
- **Idempotency Token (`Idempotency-Key`)**:
    - **Workflow**:
        1. The client generates a unique ID (e.g., a UUID) for each transaction and sends it in a request header, typically `Idempotency-Key`.
        2. The server receives the request and first checks if this key has been processed before (usually by looking it up in a fast store like Redis).
        3. If the key is **new**, the server processes the request and stores the result against the key with a reasonable TTL (e.g., 24 hours).
        4. If the key **exists**, the server skips processing and immediately returns the stored result.
    - **Benefit**: This is a best-practice API design pattern that safely handles network retries from clients or upstream services.

## 3. Layer 2: Cache Layer (Redis)

The cache provides high-performance atomic operations, making it an ideal first line of defense against near-simultaneous duplicate requests before they hit the database.

- **Distributed Lock (`SET NX`)**:
    - **Command**: `SET resource_key request_id NX EX 60`
    - **Explanation**: The `NX` (Not Exists) option ensures that the `SET` command only succeeds if the `resource_key` (e.g., `userId:productId`) does not already exist. This guarantees that only the first of many concurrent requests can acquire the "lock" and proceed. Subsequent requests within the expiry window will fail to acquire the lock and can be safely rejected.
    - **Use Case**: Perfect for preventing a user from performing the exact same action (e.g., clicking "add to cart" rapidly) in a very short time frame.

## 4. Layer 3: Message Queue (Kafka / RabbitMQ)

In asynchronous systems, both producers and consumers can introduce duplicates. Ensuring idempotent processing is critical.

- **Producer Side**:
    - **Configuration**: In Kafka, enable the idempotent producer (`enable.idempotence=true`) and set `acks=all`.
    - **Effect**: This prevents the broker from creating duplicate messages due to network errors or leader elections.

- **Consumer Side**:
    - **Problem**: A consumer might successfully process a message but crash before committing its offset. Upon restart, it will consume the same message again.
    - **Solution**: The consumer's processing logic must be made idempotent. This is best achieved by using the techniques in the database layer. Before processing, the consumer can check if the message's unique business ID has already been processed.

---

## 5. Layer 4: Database (MySQL / PostgreSQL)

The database is the ultimate source of truth and the final, most powerful line of defense for data consistency.

- **Unique Constraints (`UNIQUE KEY`)**:
    - **How**: Define a unique index on a column that should be unique, such as a `request_id` or a composite key like `(user_id, order_id)`.
    - **Effect**: The database will physically reject any attempt to insert a duplicate value for that key. This is the simplest and most reliable way to prevent duplicate records.

- **Optimistic Locking**:
    - **How**: Add a `version` column to the table. When updating a row, the `WHERE` clause must check for the original version number, and the `SET` clause must increment it: `UPDATE products SET stock = stock - 1, version = version + 1 WHERE id = ? AND stock > 0 AND version = [original_version];`
    - **Effect**: If the number of affected rows is 0, it means another process updated the record first. The application can then choose to retry the transaction or fail gracefully. This is the ideal solution for preventing the "overselling stock" problem.

- **Pessimistic Locking**:
    - **How**: Use `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` within a transaction to place a lock on the rows being read.
    - **Effect**: This blocks any other transaction from modifying the locked rows until the current transaction is complete. It guarantees consistency but can reduce concurrency, so it's best used when conflicts are very frequent.

## 6. The Role of the Application Layer (Orchestration)

The previous layers are tools. The application (e.g., a Spring Boot service) is the **orchestrator** that intelligently uses these tools to implement the business logic correctly. Relying only on the database or cache is insufficient.

### Example Implementation in Spring

**A. API Controller (`@RestController`)**
The controller is the ideal place to handle the `Idempotency-Key` pattern. This can be implemented cleanly using a Spring `Filter` or an AOP `@Aspect`.
- **Logic**:
    1. Intercept the incoming request and extract the `Idempotency-Key` header.
    2. Use `RedisTemplate` to check if the key exists in Redis.
    3. If it exists, retrieve the cached `ResponseEntity` and return it immediately, short-circuiting the controller method.
    4. If not, allow the controller method to execute. After it returns, store the `ResponseEntity` in Redis against the key.

**B. Service Layer (`@Service`)**
This is where core business logic resides and where multiple layers of defense are coordinated.
- **Logic for a `placeOrder` method**:
    1. **Fast Lock (Cache)**: Immediately attempt to acquire a distributed lock using `redisTemplate.opsForValue().setIfAbsent("lock:user:123:product:456", "locked", 10, TimeUnit.SECONDS)`. If this fails, return a `429 Too Many Requests` error. This prevents a costly race to the database.
    2. **DB Interaction (Database)**: Call the JPA repository to save the order. This operation must be wrapped in a `try-catch` block.
    3. **Handle DB Errors**: Catch the `DataIntegrityViolationException` that Spring throws if the database's `UNIQUE KEY` constraint is violated. Translate this low-level error into a meaningful business response, like a `409 Conflict` with the message "Order has already been processed."

**C. Message Listener (`@KafkaListener`)**
Message consumers must be designed to be idempotent, as `at-least-once` delivery guarantees that duplicates can occur.
- **Logic**:
    1. The listener receives a message containing a unique business ID (e.g., `paymentId`).
    2. Before processing, check a dedicated table or a Redis set to see if this `paymentId` has already been successfully processed.
    3. If it has, log a warning, commit the Kafka offset, and ignore the message.
    4. If not, start a database transaction. Inside the transaction, perform the business logic (e.g., update user balance) AND insert the `paymentId` into the "processed messages" table. If the transaction succeeds, the operation is complete and idempotent.

## 7. Summary: Defense in Depth

A robust deduplication strategy is not about choosing one tool, but about orchestrating a multi-layered defense:

- The **Application Layer** acts as the brain, coordinating the entire process.
- The **API Layer** handles client and network retries.
- The **Cache Layer** absorbs high-frequency concurrent requests.
- The **Message Queue** ensures idempotent processing in async workflows.
- The **Database Layer** provides the ultimate, non-negotiable guarantee of data integrity.
