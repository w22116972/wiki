# The 5 love languages

## Abstract

Everyone has their own love language, which is their unique way of expressing and receiving love. If you constantly use the wrong language to show your love, the other person might feel unloved.

### Words of Affirmation

Definition: Expressing love through spoken or written words of praise, appreciation, and encouragement.

Goal: Make the other person feel valued.

Example: Saying, "I'm so grateful for you" instead of just "I love you."

### Quality Time:

Definition: Giving someone your undivided attention, spending meaningful time together, and engaging in activities that foster connection.

Goal: Make the other person feel important and cherished.

Example: "Let's turn off our phones and just talk tonight," or "How about we go for a walk and catch up?"

### Receiving Gifts:

Definition: Showing love through thoughtful gifts that demonstrate you are thinking of the person.

Goal: Make the other person feel appreciated and remembered.

Example: Giving a small, thoughtful gift like a favorite book or a handwritten note.

### Acts of Service:

Definition: Doing helpful things for the person you love, such as chores, errands, or any kind of assistance that makes their life easier.

Goal: Make the other person feel supported and cared for.

Example: Cooking a meal, doing the laundry, or running errands for them.

### Physical Touch:

Definition: Expressing love through physical affection, such as hugs, kisses, holding hands, and other forms of non-verbal physical contact.

Goal: Make the other person feel loved and secure.

Example: Giving a warm hug, holding hands while walking, or a gentle touch on the arm.
