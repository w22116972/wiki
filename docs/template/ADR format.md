# Architectural Decision Records
> describes a choice the team makes about a significant aspect of the software architecture theyâ€™re planning to build. 
> Each ADR describes the architectural decision, its context, and its consequences. 
> ADRs have states and therefore follow a lifecycle.

focuses on the reason for the decision rather than how the team implemented it

## When to use?

- When there are two or more engineering options and you want to document your thoughts and reasons behind the selection.
- When you have a technical challenge or question and there's no existing basis for a decision, such as a recommended solution, standard operation procedure, blueprint, or codebase.
