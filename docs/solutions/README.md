# Algorithms and data structures for massive datasets

For traditional CPU-intensive application
- assume all data fits in memory
- bottleneck is calculation, only consider big O analysis
 
For data-intensive application
- data is too large to fit in memory
- bottleneck is IO, consider data structures and algorithms that minimize IO
  - back-forth between disk and memory
  - network transfer
