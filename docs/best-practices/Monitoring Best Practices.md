# Monitoring Best Practices

### What to monitor?

- Uptime: Availability of the system (what percentage of time the system is up and running)
- CPU, Memory, Disk, Network: Resource usage
- Response time: How long it takes to respond to a request (p95? p99?)
- Error rate: what percentage of requests are errors
